  <h1>Little Victories</h1>

  <p>
    Job searching is a grind, and it's easy to burn out when you can't see
    progress. So I'm turning it into a game!
  </p>

  <p>
    Complete 15 actionable tasks each week (that's 3 tasks a day) to travel the
    path of landing a job and unlocking a prize. Each step of the path lets you
    select from a randomized list of tasks, so there's always one you can do.
  </p>

  <p>
    Your progress stays until you complete 15 tasks, so your actions aren't
    wasted when you have a hard week (and can be increased if you're having a
    good week). Your prizes are saved to your profile so you can visualize your
    progress.
