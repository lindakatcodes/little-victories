<p>
  Job searching is a grind, and it's easy to burn out when you can't see
  progress. So I'm turning it into a game!
</p>

<p>
  Complete 15 actionable tasks each week (that's 3 tasks a day) to travel the
  path of landing a job and unlocking a prize. Each step of the path lets you
  select from a randomized list of tasks, so there's always one you can do.
</p>

<p>
  Your progress stays until you complete 15 tasks, so your actions aren't wasted
  when you have a hard week (and can be increased if you're having a good week).
  Your prizes are saved to your profile so you can visualize your progress.
